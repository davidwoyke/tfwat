[{"id":0,"href":"/","title":"Index","section":"The Flames Witnessed at Temperance","content":"\rAbout\r#\rThis is a tiny adventure location designed for about 6 characters of levels 1– 2. It is heavily inspired by the dungeon synth album The Sleeping Wizard by Umbría.\nMaps at center. Wandering monsters table on back.\nConcept, writing, design, and layout by D. D. Gant. Cover art by Joan Llopis Doménech.\nHistory\r#\rThe isolated islet of Temperance floats a hundred fathoms from the stony shore of the grey sea. A weathered structure of brick and plank supports a decrepit lighthouse there. Local legend speculates the place was once home to an eccentric scholar and practicer of magics. For the better part of a century, the lighthouse has stood dormant, and the forces of nature have all but reclaimed the utilitarian facade. Of late, crabbers and leech collectors report a dim, flickering light on the horizon during the early morning hours of their commute. Under the high sun, the anxious waves crash down upon an idle dock, which guards the only path up to the crowning edifice. Days pass, the light burns, and rumor spreads. The coast is alive with story, and the flames at Temperance burn once more.\nThe wizard of the islet, Prowst, has entered into a deep, magical slumber, intending to wait out the results of a century-long experiment. He has left behind his trusted familiar, Eku the toad, to care for the facility and guard against malicious intruders. One of Prowst\u0026rsquo;s academic rivals has sent their own familiar, Nima the rat, to meddle with the experiment. The forces of Nima have acted to prevent the wizard\u0026rsquo;s rousing, and his uneasy dreams now seep into reality. In distress, Eku lit the beacon atop the lighthouse, chancing to attract a savior to rescue Prowst and sway the fate of the islet of Temperance— before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nWaking Up\r#\rEverything strange happening on the islet is a part of a dream or a nightmare. Real creatures that die in either one of these alternate realities do not actually die— they wake up— in a cold sweat at a randomly determined location upon the islet.\nLying on the Dock. Half-buried in the sand on the Half-Moon Shore. In the shade of the Trees that Will Remember. In the tall grass at the Path of the Fae Knight. Nestled in an armchair for the Lost Wanderer. In pews of the Sancta Sanctorum. Nightmare\r#\rWandering into the The Forest\u0026rsquo;s Hug (area 10) leads deeper into the subconscious of the wizard\u0026rsquo;s nightmares. A dimension door there leads back to the surface of the islet, but to a different reality that has skewed further toward chaos. Some areas feature ``nightmare affectations\u0026quot; that are only visible after this point. Areas that do not feature nightmare affectations remain the same, just darker, bleaker, and more otherworldly. It is not possible to return from the nightmare without either dying (waking up) or waking up Prowst. The only way to wake up Prowst is to kill him in his own nightmare.\nMaps\r#\rWandering Monsters\r#\rIn a dream\u0026hellip;\r#\rAnthropomorphic rats, vandalizing anything. Deer wearing prayer bead necklaces clip-clop out of a nearby room. A passing vision of the red-cloaked wizard, betwixt distant objects. Harmless clumps of sentient fungus slither into unsuspecting boots. The islet shakes. Save vs paralysis or fall, breaking a fragile item. A slight gust blows a sprinkle of sand into the eyes of a random victim. Tired, they will fall into sleep in 1d3 turns. In a nightmare\u0026hellip;\r#\rBloodthirsty, barb-tailed bat-creatures descend. Skeletons, shovels in hand, solemnly digging their own graves. A red-hot meteor fragment obliterates something nearby. Sections of the ground melt away into puddles of gooey black pudding. The world goes dark for 1d6 turns. Without torchlight, you are lost. A single mare, a stunted, hairless, malicious dream demon, leaps upon the chest of its victim, toppling them. "}]
